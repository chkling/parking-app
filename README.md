Parking Pal is an application allowing users to rent out their driveway space or find driveway parking at a hosted location. Once the user accesses the application, they may choose between parking or hosting. To find parking, the user will input their address for a list of available driveway parking near that location. To host, the user will enter their information along with the number of parking spaces they have available to rent.
