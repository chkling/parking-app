Parking Pal is an application allowing users to rent out their driveway space or find driveway parking at a hosted location. Once the user accesses the application, they may choose between parking or hosting. To find parking, the user will input their address for a list of available driveway parking near that location. To host, the user will enter their information along with the number of parking spaces they have available to rent.

This was built using JavaScript, React functional components, React router and Redux. User and host data is stored using Supabase.
